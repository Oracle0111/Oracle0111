I am Emmanuel a young youth.
Over the years I've lived with the passion of giving in me and helping the less privileged.
I'm certain to have groups world wide in assembling this powerful mission and helping the disaster affected citizens, disability affected citizens and also the street beggers because everyone needs to be cared for,any sudden situation we find ourselves in which is bad is a mistake it isn't God's work.
I pray i accomplish my goals and fundraise enough to do good works
